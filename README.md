# GameFusionEngine
Game engine for creating 2D - games on Java.

Project just for fun. Rendering based on Java Swing.

# Animation
The engine supports animation. To create an animation you should specify frames of the animation.

# Levels
To create a level you should create class representing the level. You can overload methods that process some events (e. g. level inited, level updated, etc)

# Game entities
The engine supports autodetects collisions between game entities. If entity A collides with entity B, the engine send them signals about that.
